/* Method userControllerResetAndRun is called when the simulation
   is doing a contest Run
   
   It will have cleared sensor definitions, so best to call userInit()
   Also, anything related to controller state should be reset.
   
   You may want to verify that multiple R)un commands has same behavior 
   as inital run when sketch is started. One possible problem is not zeroing
   variables that are expected to be zero when program starts might result
   in differing behavior.
