/* Sensors - Line, Arc and Spot Sensors

Option for vertical line sensor orientation, implemented, but not used/tested.
To use, set vertLine=true after creating instance of LineSensor. 

Ron Grant  June 2020

June 30,2020  per Will - "spot" name for rectangular array of pixels sampled by spot sensor
                         line sensor samples an array of spots, assumed to be adjacent in robot Y (left right) direction
                         without overlap or separation.
                         
Jun 30 20  - corrected truncation error in halfWidth calculation for line sensor offset                         
 
Aug 22 20  - implemented setArcRadius(r) method. Call after creating LineSensor instance make line into
             180 degree arc centered at line "center" x,y.
             
             Corrected 1/2 pixel offset error. 
             Line sensor with 9 5x5 spot sensors centered at robot y=0, appears centered on line when robot center 
             is centered on line, e.g. Challenge course y=12.0 heading 0, course line straight ahead, sensor balanced 
             on line. Also, arc sensor looked good e.g. 9 sensor arc "balanced".
             
             
 
Sept 13 20   Implemented setSpanDeltaX (deltaX for entire sensor span in inches) allowing sloped sensor lines
             Now allow combination of all modifiers (vertical line with radius now 1/2 circle)
             
                setArcRadius(r)      // when set to non zero value sensor spots form 1/2 circle with radius r (inches)
                setVertical(enable)  // now simple reverse of X,Y offsets relative to line "center"
                setDeltaX(d)         // deltaX for entire sensor span (use negative value to create negative slope) 
                
                If you have used vertical sensor lines in previous versions be sure to verify  
                sensor cell order. 
                


User defines spot and line sensors in setup()

A spot sensor samples a rectangular array of screen pixels referred to as a "spot".
A line sensor samples a linear array of spots which are ,for now, adjacent with no space between them, or overlap.
   

updateSensors() called from drawWorld() when view rendered to screen of overhead view of robot pointing toward top of screen.
This method calculates an intensity value 0.0 to 1.0 for each spot sensor spot. Also it calculates the intensity value for each spot
in the linear array of spots of a line sensor which it stores in an array which can be accessed by calling read() method for each.

A spot sensor returns a float value.
The line sensor returns a reference to float array.

e.g. for line sensor  

float[] lineData = lineSensor.read();
