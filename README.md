# LineFollowerSimLib
Processing library and example Processing sketches for creating Line Follower Simulation


Sorry I killed Readme   ==  should have fixed by tomorrow -- newbie problems...  
Version control not so good when you overwrite...

Download .zip file and extract LineFollowerSim folder, copy to Processing sketchbook libraries subfolder
Start/Restart Processing  File>Examples  you will find Two example sketches

To locate your processing sketchbook, In Processing menu File>Preferences, path will be displayed
under C:\sketches
